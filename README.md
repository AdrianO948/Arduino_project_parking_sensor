# Arduino_project_parking_sensor
It is a simple arduino project using 7-segments display, arduino uno board, distance sensor HC-04, 8 resistors with 220R resistance.
When the arduino is running the display starts displaying distance from sensor to any object in tens of centimeters. For example for distance between 2 and 10 cm it displays 0, between 50 and 60 it displays 5. For distances over 100 cm it displays number with a dot, for instance: between 101 and 110 - 0. , between 150 and 160 - 5.
I am going to upgrade it as soon as possible so it will be using one OLED display SSD1306 (128x64).
